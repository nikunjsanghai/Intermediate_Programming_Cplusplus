### String Stream
A stringstream associates a string object with a stream allowing you to read from the string as if it were a stream (like cin). 
To use stringstream, we need to include sstream header file. The stringstream class is extremely useful in parsing input. 

Basic methods are:

- clear()- To clear the stream.
- str()- To get and set string object whose content is present in the stream. 
- operator <<- Add a string to the stringstream object. 
- operator >>- Read something from the stringstream object.
