### Static 
Static data members are class members that are declared using static keywords. A static member has certain special characteristics. These are:          

- Only one copy of that member is created for the entire class and is shared by all the objects of that class, no matter how many objects are created.
- It is initialized before any object of this class is being created, even before main starts.
- It is visible only within the class, but its lifetime is the entire program.
