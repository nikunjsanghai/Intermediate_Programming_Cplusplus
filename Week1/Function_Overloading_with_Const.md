### Function Overloading with respect to const.
C++ allows member methods to be overloaded on the basis of const type. Overloading on the basis of const type can be useful when a function returns a reference or pointer.
We can make one function const, that returns a const reference or const pointer, and another non-const function, that returns a non-const reference or pointer.

**Example**
```
fun() 
fun() const 
```
The two methods ‘void fun() const’ and ‘void fun()’ have the same signature except that one is const and the other is not.
Also, if we take a closer look at the output, we observe that ‘const void fun()’ is called on the const object, and ‘void fun()’ is called on the non-const object.            

Program 1:
```
// PROGRAM 1 (Fails in compilation)
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
void fun(const int i)
{
    cout << "fun(const int) called ";
}
void fun(int i)
{
    cout << "fun(int ) called " ;
}
int main()
{
    const int i = 10;
    fun(i);
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
Compile Error
```
Why does this code fail ?                 

Program 2:
```
// PROGRAM 2 (Compiles and runs fine)
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
void fun(char *a)
{
cout << "non-const fun() " << a;
}
 
void fun(const char *a)
{
cout << "const fun() " << a;
}
 
int main()
{
const char *ptr = "GeeksforGeeks";
fun(ptr);
return 0;
}
```
C++ allows functions to be overloaded on the basis of the const-ness of parameters only if the const parameter is a reference or a pointer. 
This rule actually makes sense.           
- In program 1, the parameter ‘i’ is passed by value,so ‘i’ in fun() is a copy of ‘i’ in main(). Hence fun() irrespective of const or non-const cannot modify ‘i’ of main().
Therefore, it doesn’t matter whether ‘i’ is received as a const parameter or a normal parameter.This redudancy causes the error.                
- When we pass by reference or pointer,we can modify the value referred or pointed, so we can have two versions of a function,
one which can modify the referred or pointed value, other which can not. Compiler is able to differentiate between the two and overload them.
